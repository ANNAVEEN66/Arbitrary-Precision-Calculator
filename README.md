# Arbitrary-Precision-Calculator
An Arbitrary Precision Calculator is a program that allows calculations with numbers far larger or more precise than standard data types (int, float, double) can handle. This is useful when working with very large integers or high-precision decimal numbers, which are common in scientific computing, cryptography, and mathematical research.
✨ Features

Support for very large integers beyond standard data types.

Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Handle decimal numbers with high precision.

User-friendly console interface.

Input numbers as strings to avoid overflow.

🔑 Core Concepts Demonstrated

String/Array Manipulation → Represent numbers as arrays of digits.

Arithmetic Algorithms → Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

Handling Large Numbers → Avoid data type limits.

High Precision Calculations → Decimal operations with arbitrary precision.
📝 Sample Code Snippet
Example: Adding two large numbers using strings:
void addLargeNumbers(char num1[], char num2[], char result[]) {
    int len1 = strlen(num1);
    int len2 = strlen(num2);
    int carry = 0, sum = 0;
    int i = len1 - 1, j = len2 - 1, k = 0;
    char temp[1024] = {0};

    while (i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry) {
        int digit1 = (i >= 0) ? num1[i--] - '0' : 0;
        int digit2 = (j >= 0) ? num2[j--] - '0' : 0;
        sum = digit1 + digit2 + carry;
        temp[k++] = (sum % 10) + '0';
        carry = sum / 10;
    }

    // Reverse result
    for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        result[l] = temp[k - l - 1];
    }
    result[k] = '\0';
}
📌 Future Enhancements
