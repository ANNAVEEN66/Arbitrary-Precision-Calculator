# Arbitrary-Precision-Calculator
An Arbitrary Precision Calculator is a program that allows calculations with numbers far larger or more precise than standard data types (int, float, double) can handle. This is useful when working with very large integers or high-precision decimal numbers, which are common in scientific computing, cryptography, and mathematical research.
